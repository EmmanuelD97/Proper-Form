1,bicep curls,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The bicep curl is a general title for a series of strength exercises that involve brachioradialis front deltoid and the main target on biceps brachii. Includes variations using barbell dumbbell and resistance band etc. The common point amongst them is the trainee lifting a certain amount of weight to contracting the biceps brachii and tuck in their arms to the torso during the concentric phase. Once the biceps brachii is fully contracted then return the weight to starting position during the eccentric phase.
