1,Curl ,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Bicep Curl is a general title for a series of strength exercises that involve brachioradialis front deltoid and the main target on biceps brachii.The main benefit is it helps to increase your biceps size and strength. This exercise includes variations using barbell dumbbell and resistance band etc. The common point amongst them is the trainee lifting a certain amount of weight to contracting the biceps brachii and tuck in their arms to the torso during the concentric phase. Once the biceps brachii is fully contracted then return the weight to starting position during the eccentric phase.
2,Hammer Curl,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Hammer Curl targets the biceps and forearms. The exercise is performed with dumbbells and it strengthens the three largest muscles along the front of the upper arms. Make sure not to lean back or swing the weights to gain all the benefits of the exercise. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand holding them alongside you. Your palms should face your body. Keep your feet hip width apart and engage your core to stabilize the body.Keep your biceps stationary and start bending at your elbows lifting both dumbbells. Lift until the dumbbells reach shoulder level but do not actually touch your shoulders. Hold this contraction briefly and \then lower back to the starting position and repeat.
3,Skull crusher,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Skull Crusher is a push exercise that works the triceps brachii in isolation. This exercise is often used to fix imbalances with the triceps and for injury rehabilitation. Hold the dumbbell with both hands above your chest and straight up with the dumbbell shaft in a vertical position. Move the weight down toward the rear of your head by flexing your elbows while exhaling. The motion takes place in the elbows while upper arms generally remain perpendicular to the body. Keep the upper arms from moving back and forth with the weight as this transfers some of the work to the shoulders instead of focusing it on the triceps. Continue lowering the weight behind the head until the dumbbell head is about in line with the bench top or a little higher if feels unwieldy. Reverse the movement until the weight is held above the chest in the starting position again. Don't lock the elbows at the starting position instead stop just shy of locked position to maintain tension in your muscle.Repeat.
4,Squats,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Squat exercise mainly targets the thighs (quadriceps & hamstrings) and the glutes. Squats help to get toned legs and calves.They promote body-wide muscle building by creating an anabolic (muscle building) environment in the body. They work up your abdominal muscles and lower back. A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. The hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes during the descent of a squat. Conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.
5,Sumo squat,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Sumo Squat is a lower-body strength exercise that is a variation of a standard squat. The key difference in this squat is that you take a wider stance and position your feet turned out. The leg positioning of the sumo squat works the inner thighs which the other squats do not target. It also works the core muscle. Start in a standing position with your feet wide apart around a foot (30cm) beyond your shoulder on each side and your toes pointing at 45Â° angles. Drop into a squat bending at the hips and knees and sitting back. 
6,lunge,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Lunges are a good exercise to help build and strengthen hamstrings hips quads and glutes. Lunges are best done at the start of the leg day workout and work best with moderate weight. When performing dumbbell lunges you can choose to use either a barbell or dumbbells. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Engage your core. Take a big step forward with right leg. Start to shift your weight forward so heel hits the floor first.  Lower your body until right thigh is parallel to the floor and right shin is vertical. It is fine if knee shifts forward a little as long as it does not go past right toe. If mobility allows lightly tap left knee to the floor while keeping weight in right heel. Press into right heel to drive back up to starting position. Repeat on the other side.
7,Reverse  lunge,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Reverse Lunge exercise places less stress on the knees while still toning the entire leg. The Reverse Lunge is great for developing an athletic lower body and perfect for any sport requiring speed and power. Stand upright with your hands at your hips. Take a large step backward with your left foot. Lower your hips so that your right thigh (front leg) becomes parallel to the floor with your right knee positioned directly over your ankle.Your left knee should be bent at a 90-degree angle and pointing toward the floor with your left heel lifted.Return to standing by pressing your right heel into the floor and bringing your left leg forward to complete one rep. Alternate legs and repeat the steps.
8,curtsy  lunge,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Curtsy Lunge is a great exercise to stabilize your hips. This is a variant of a standard lunge which helps in additional glute strengthening. Curtsy lunges target your inner thighs as well as your glute medius that helps stabilize hips to help improve your posture. The starting position is to stand straight with your feet wider than shoulder width apart. Hold your hands on your hips.Then step your left leg behind you and to the right so your thighs cross bending both knees as if you are curtsying. Return to the starting position and switch legs
9,deadlift,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips with torso perpendicular to the floor before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises. Bend at the knees with feet flat on the floor and grab the bar with hands shoulder-width apart. Always squeeze the bar as hard as you can especially on heavier sets before the bar leaves the floor. Keep your head in a neutral position by looking forwards with your eyes fixed to a spot on the ground ahead of your feet. Keep your chin up so your head stays in the best position for lifting. Keeping your back straight and your head facing forward throughout lift the bar using your legs and driving your hips forward. The deadlift should be a fast and powerful lift using your legs and glute strength. Drive upwards as explosively as possible. Aim to maintain a strong spine from the beginning of the lift to the end. Your shoulders should remain slightly in front of your hands until the bar passes mid-thigh level at which point you want to retract your shoulder blades for a strong and stable torso.Pull your shoulders back at the top of the move then carefully lower the bar to the ground.
10,Reverse fly,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The reverse fly targets the rear and posterior deltoids which are the main muscles on the back of the shoulder alongside the trapezius. It is a resistance exercise that helps strenghtening the back muscles to improve poor posture promoting an upright stance and improve balance. Sit on the bench holding a set of dumbbells wiith your feet flat on the ground then hinge at the waist to lean forward slightly and bring your dumbbells behind your calves with palms facing each other. Raise your arms outward and squeeze your shoulder blade with a slight bend at the elbow keeping your palms facing the floor. Release your arms slowly and repeat.
11,Reverse row,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Reverse Row is compound exercise used to build strength and size in both the lower and upper back. It targets nearly all the muscles in the back but particularly the lateral and lower back. Set the bar around waist height. Lowering the bar makes the movement more difficult. Position yourself under the bar lying face up. Lie on the floor underneath the bar. Grab the bar with an overhand grip with slightly wider than shoulder width and palms facing away. Contract your abs and butt and keep your body a completely straight line. Pull yourself up to the bar until your chest touches the bar. Lower yourself back down with proper form.
12,Chest Press,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Chest Press targets the pectorals deltoids and triceps building muscle tissue and strength. To accomplish this lie on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand and your feet flat on the floor. You can rest your feet up on the bench if it's more comfortable. Push the dumbbells up so that your arms are directly over your shoulders and your palms are up. Pull your abdominals in and tilt your chin toward your chest.
13,decline chest press,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The decline Chest press is an excellent exercise for strengthening the lower chest muscles. In a decline bench press the bench is set to 15 to 30 degrees on a decline. This angle places the upper body on a downward slope which activates the lower pectoral muscles as you push weights away from the body. To carry out this exercise secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. Using a medium width grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked.
14,incline chest press,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Incline Chest Press is designed to target the chest shoulders and triceps hitting each side of the body independently. This is a great exercise to develop the upper portion of the pectoral muscles. For execution of this exercise the bench is set at an incline (15 to 45 degrees) so that you activate your shoulders more as it imitates a shoulder press. Not only it activates the shoulder but also puts less stress on the rotator cuff which is a common area for injury when using the flat bench. Lie on your back on the bench and hold a pair of dumbbells directly above your shoulders with your arms fully extended. Pull your shoulder blades together and slightly stick out your chest. Lower both dumbbells to the sides of your chest
15,Fly,ZRTyv9zSx2M,A Fly or Flye is a free weight exercise that is used to work the muscles of the upper body. It is considered strength training for the pectoral muscles to accomplish this: the user focuses on their pectoral muscles while the hand and arm move through an arc while the elbow is kept at a constant angle. When reversing the movement the elbow is kept at a constant angle while the hand and arm move back to the starting position of the exercise. Remember to focus on the pectoral muscles throughout the movements. 
16,incline fly,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Incline Flye majorly focuses on the upper pectoral muscles. It also targets anterior deltoids and arm muscles(biceps and triceps). It helps strenghtening core and lower body engagement while maintaining stability on the bench. Set the bench up at an incline of around 30Â° to perfrom this exercise. Then lie back and perform the flye as you would with a flat bench but place extra focus on slowly bringing the weights down to avoid overstretching the pectoral muscles. 
17,reverse fly,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Reverse Fly targets the rear and posterior deltoids which are the main muscles on the back of the shoulder alongside the trapezius. It is a resistance exercise that helps strenghtening the back muscles to improve poor posture promoting an upright stance and improve balance. Sit on the bench holding a set of dumbbells wiith your feet flat on the ground then hinge at the waist to lean forward slightly and bring your dumbbells behind your calves with palms facing each other. Raise your arms outward and squeeze your shoulder blade with a slight bend at the elbow keeping your palms facing the floor. Release your arms slowly and repeat.
18,alt front raise,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Alternate Front Raise mainly focus on the anterior deltoid and has a secondary effect on the lateral deltoid. It also impacts on clavicular pectoralis major and lower trapezius. It is an exercise that isolates and hits the front deltoid. The starting postion is to stand holding a dumbbell in each hand with elbows slightly bent and the dumbbells resting on the front of the thighs.Keeping elbow slightly bent exhale as you raise your right arm in front of you until it is at least parallel to the floor. Hold for a count of two. Inhale as you lower your right arm to the starting position. Repeat with your left arm. Keep alternating your arms raising one after the other one has been fully lowered.
19,shoulder press,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Shoulder Press is a free weight exercise that mainly targets the deltoid muscles on the shoulders with the help from the chest and arm muscles. This exercise helps in increasing strength and size of the shoulder muscles as well as strength and size of the triceps muscles and trapezius muscle.  It is performed typically standing in which a weight is pressed straight upwards from racking position until the arms are locked out overhead while the legs with lower back and abs maintain balance.
20,upright row,ZRTyv9zSx2M,The Upright Row exercises the front and middle heads of the deltoids as well as the trapezius and rhomboids. Grab dumbbells and allow it to hang in front of you at the length of your arms. Your palms should be facing your body. Standing up straight and adjust your grip so that your hands are about in line with the thighs. Shoulder-width apart is recommended for wrist and shoulder safety. Breathe in and brace the abdominals keeping the back straight and chest up with eyes focused forward. Lift the dumbbells straight up toward the chin leading with the elbows and keeping them close to the body. Breathe out during the effort. Your arms should go no higher than parallel with the shoulders. Pause at the top of the lift. Return the barbell back to the starting position breathing in as you lower it. Repeat the move for your defined number of repetitions.
